## About the Project

**The Problem:** AI companies are burning through compute costs without visibility into profitability per customer, feature, or agent. Most developers discover they're losing money only after the damage is done.

**Our Solution:** Real-time cost tracking, margin analysis, and pricing optimization specifically designed for AI applications.

## Key Features

- **Customer & Agent Analytics**: Track costs, usage, and profitability per customer.
- **Real-time Metering**: Real-time cost tracking across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more
- **Know Your Margins**: Margin analysis per customer, feature, and AI agent.
- **Scalable by Design**: Built for high-volume requests.
- **5-Minute Setup**: Launch locally with Docker.
- **Self-Hosted & Secure**: Your data, your infrastructure. Total privacy.

## Documentation

Check out [Frost AI docs](https://docs.frostai.dev) or jump into the [Frost Discord server](https://discord.gg/YhRK2JSuQa).

## Roadmap

Our vision is to build it into a complete, end-to-end billing solution for AI companies.

- [ ] **Subscription & Hybrid Pricing Models**: Move beyond simple per-action pricing to support monthly/yearly subscriptions, tiered pricing, and complex hybrid models (e.g., a base fee + overages).
- [ ] **True Billing & Invoicing**: The highest priority is to build the billing engine. This will include generating invoices from the tracked usage data and integrating with payment gateways like Stripe.
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics & Alerting**: Deeper insights, customizable reports, and automated alerts to notify you of cost spikes or low margins.
- [ ] **Client-side SDKs**: Official libraries for Python and JS/TS to make integration trivial.
